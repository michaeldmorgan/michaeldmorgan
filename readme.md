- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @michaeldmorgan
- ðŸ”¨ I currently work at the intersection of eCommerce and Web3 (specifically, no-code and no-crypto integrations of offering NFTs for sale on brand websites).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in integrating Web3 tech in seamless engagement points that 1.) enhance the user experience, 2.) engage in native user experiences (i.e. mapped to meet curring consuemr/user behaviors and expectations), and 3.) abstract crypto from the users (abstracts wallets, seed phrases, crypto - all until the point that users become sophisticated enough that they want to take self custody and manage their own wallets and web3 engagement points)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about creating dynamic NFTs, soulbound NFTs, and other niche NFT and crypto solutions (predominantly EVM compatible, but with a growing interest in the Stacks blockchain)
